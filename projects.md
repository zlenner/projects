Super-super interesting iOS app which will be doing something that hasn't done before, and would make my life (and I would assume the same for a lot of people) much easier.

The technically challenging part is it'll need to efficiently stream, process, and store data on-the-fly. The data is-kind-of heavy.

Can provide more details after an initial chat on Discord.

Hiring for three roles:
- iOS
- Backend
- Frontend (Web App)

## How we'll do this:

For the prototype, we need either an iOS developer or Web Developer first along with someone who'll do the backend.

I have the exact architecture we need for this in mind, we'll debate if we have a better way of doing this, and then work very, very fast on this to build out a first prototype (using either an iOS or Web frontend).

## Why

- It's something super-interesting and new (not related to QR codes though)
- There are no formalities. The only focus is getting the job done.
- Your current work bores you out of your mind.
- Compensation will be competitive.

## Opinions I have that you *need* know about:

a) Everyone can question everyone, and everything. The strength of your argument matters, not your personality.

b) Simplicity is key. If something can be done with the same efficiency in a more explicit, easier-to-understand way, that's the only way to do it.

## If you want in:

Message me on Discord with the answer to this question:

- What's the project you've had the best time working on?
