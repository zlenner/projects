# [Pintail]()

```
iOS app which will need to efficiently stream, store data on-the-fly for kind-of heavy data.

Can provide more details after an initial chat on Discord!

Hiring for three roles:
- iOS
- Backend
- Frontend (Web App)

## How we'll do this:

I have the exact architecture we need for this in mind, we'll debate if we have a better way of doing this, and then work very, very fast on this to build out a first prototype.

## If you want in:

Message me on Discord with the answer to this question:

- What's the project you've had the best time working on?
